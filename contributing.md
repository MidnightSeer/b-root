# How to contribute
The primary way to contribute is to create additional plugins for the broot framework.  The beauty in broot is that you can create your own plugin using the specified template and the framework will seemlessly accept it as a "plug-n-play" style plugin.  In order for this to work, you do need to have specific sections in your plugin, to be discussed in the next sections.

## Plugin Template
You must complete a minimum of 6 sections to effectively work with the broot framework.

### Section 0 - Default Imports *DO NOT CHANGE*
For normal usage, this section should not change.  It consists of default imports that all plugins need available.  

### Section 1 - Imports
Use this section if you need 3rd party python modules that are not included inthe main python installation.  It is prefered to use as many default modules, however we know that this is sometime unrealisticl; therefore this section allow you to import these pre-requisites as well as auto install any new ones.

To make it a little easier, the lines commented with "#HERE" need to be modified.

**Example**
<new_module_here> --> *requests*
