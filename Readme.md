# BROOT

This is a bruteforcing framework that takes advantage of the "plug-n-play" approach offered by python.  Modular behavior allows this framework to remain static while scaling available plugins or "modules."

Time to "be root," **broot**

## Getting Started

This code is written exclusively for python3 with no plans to port it to python2 or a different language.  The main "broot" framework aims to utilize packages included in the python installation.  The one exception to this is 'Prettytables.'  You have two choices to install that pre-requisite:
#1:
```
pip prettytables
```
#2:
Let the script install dependencies for you.  View the "requires.py" file to understand how this work; essentially it invokes 'pip' for you.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
