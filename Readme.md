# BROOT

This is a bruteforcing framework that takes advantage of the "plug-n-play" approach offered by python.  Modular behavior allows this framework to remain static while scaling available plugins or "modules."

Time to "be root," **broot**

## Getting Started

This code is written exclusively for python3 with no plans to port it to python2 or a different language.  

### Prerequisites

The main "broot" framework aims to utilize packages included in the python installation.  The one exception to this is 'Prettytables.'  You have two choices to install that pre-requisite:

#1:
```
pip prettytables
```
#2:
Let the script install dependencies for you.  View the "requires.py" file to understand how this work; essentially it invokes 'pip' for you.
